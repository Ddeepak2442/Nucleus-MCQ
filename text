These options should be generated using a separate prompt that takes the question as input. - One medium difficulty option related to the subject of the notes but not necessarily the correct answer to the specific question. - One easy option related to the subject of the notes but not necessarily the correct answer to the specific question. 4. For the medium and easy options in step 3, the prompt should be allowed to look at other relevant sources related to the subject of the notes to generate these options.
